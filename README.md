### Answer any 3 of the following questions. If you complete the required 3, you may answer a 4th question. The best 3 will count towards your final grade. Each question will be worth 6 points.

1. A Prep Freshmen in the Tech & Coding class is having trouble remembering on what days class meets during each cycle. He knows that his class only meets on A, C, and E days. It does not meet on the other days in the cycle. Write a program that will prompt the freshmen to input a letter A - G and print whether or not the Tech & Coding class is meeting. Be the program has a way to handle if the freshmen inputs a capital or lowercase letter, and if they do not input a letter at all. Be sure to use the string format method to format your print statement.

   Sample Input: `a`

   Output: `You have class today because it is A day.`

2. Oscar the Grouch is the most pessimistic resident on Sesame Street. Oscar enjoys negating people's positive sentiments as this makes them frustrated and brings him joy. Write a program for Oscar that takes a positive input, and negates it by adding "not" to the beginning. The program should then print this new, negative string. If the string already starts with "not", then just print the string as it is. Repeating things people say also annoys them, which makes Oscar happy. Be sure to have a way to handle if someone only says the word "not". Be sure to use the string format method to format your print statement.

   Sample Input: `happy`

   Output: `You're not happy. Now SCRAM!`

3. A little known fact about St. Ignatius is that he liked to gamble. Back in his day, there were only 3 numbers that made up the winning ticket. Write a program that prompts the user to input 3 integers between 1 - 50. This should be done with only one prompt. The program should then randomly choose 3 integers in the 1 - 50 without replacement. The program should print whether the user got all 3 numbers correct, some of the numbers correct, or none of the numbers correct. Be sure to use the string format method to format your print statement.

   Sample Input 1: `1 18 9`

   Output: `The winning numbers are 1, 18, and 9. You won!`
   
   Sample Input 2: `5 45 21`

   Output: `The winning numbers are 32, 5, and 10. You got one number correct!`

   Sample Input 3: `1 2 3`

   Output: `The winning numbers are 3, 27, and 44. None of your numbers were correct.`

4. The robotics team is looking for a way to control their new robot. They tried using a standard controller, but for some reason, the robot has developed an attitude and does not want to cooperate with instructions sent to it from the controller. It will only listen to a list of numbers. Write a program that allows a member of the robotics team to enter 2 sets of 3 cardinal directions (north, east, south, west) at a time. The program should than take these sets of cardinal directions and convert each cardinal direction to a number, 1-4. The program should then then create a list of all the numbers the robot needs from both sets in order to know where to move, and print this list. Be sure to use the string format method to format your print statement.

   Sample Input 1-1: `north south east`

   Sample Input 1-2: `west south west`

   Output: `In order to have the robot move ['north', 'south', 'east', 'west', 'south', 'west'], give it this sequence, [1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 4].`
